# NumberTheoryHelpers
Random functions to help solve problems assigned by Number Theory professor at CSUS.
Mainly used to help in disproving simple conjectures by finding counter examples through brute force
as tasked by the professor.
Therefore, these are written within minutes with no intention of making them faster/better unless I feel like it.

## Euler Polynomials
### Part 1
h(n) = 103n^2 - 3945n + 34381
Finds values of n so that h(n) is composite. Provides results by writing h(n) as a product of integers, each greater than 1.
